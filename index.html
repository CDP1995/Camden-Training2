        <p>-This type of tour will be set up by the leasing agents.
            When a prospect walks in and would like to visit an apartment without any appointment with a leasing agent,
            we need to ask them if they are willing to do a self guided tour.
            If the prospect agrees to do it we will need their info to send to the agents.</p>
        <p>Information required:
            <em>Name? <br>
                Phone number? <br>
                Email address? <br>
                What are they looking for (studio; 1 bedroom or 2 bedroom)? <br>
                When they would like to move in? <br>

        <p>-Residents must leave an <strong>ID</strong> every time they are using one of our carts,
            in case they do not have an <strong>ID</strong> with them ask for their apartment # and write it down in the pass down log.</p>
        <p>The keys are kept in the back on top of the black desk.
            All keys are labeled and the workers will let you know which one they want.
            Contractors/workers are required to always leave their <strong>ID</strong> while using a key.</p>

    <!-- Elevators -->
    <div class="container" type="section" id="elevator">
        <h1><strong>Elevators</strong></h1>
        <p><strong>-What to do & look for?</strong> <br>
            As soon as we find out an elevator is malfunctioning,
            we have to make sure nobody else is using it for their safety.
            To do that we will have to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grab some sign from the bottom drawer that said elevator is out of service.</li>
            <li>Place one sign outside and one inside of the elevator for residents to see as soon as they walk in.</li>
            <li>Grab some cones to place in front of the door if it is open on one of the floors,
                and one more cone will be placed in front of the door at the first floor.</li>
            <li>Turn off the light inside of the cabin.
                It is not recommended to always place the elevator on independent mode.
                If the elevator is malfunctioning but it is still in service we will have to open the box with the loading dock key to place it on independent mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>-Who to call when it’s down?</strong> <br>
            When the elevators are down we have to call Kone (phone number located in our excel sheet).
            You just report which elevator is down, what happened to it.
            Once you are done the agent will give you a reference number that you will send to our manager/Waza in the WhatsApp group chat.</p>
